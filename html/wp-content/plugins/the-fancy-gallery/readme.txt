Fancy Gallery associates linked images and galleries with the jQuery Fancybox. This Plugin has been granted the "Famous Software" Award!


== Description ==

Fancy Gallery is a state of the art WordPress Image Gallery Plugin you can use to create, manage and handle image galleries easily in your WordPress backend and present images to your website visitors.

It migrates the [Fancy Image Box](http://fancybox.net) to your WordPress. All links pointing to an image will automatically open in the FancyBox. If you use the [gallery] Short-code the images will get a navigation bar and the gallery itself will be converted to a valid XHTML block.

Of course you can use 'exclude' and 'include' parameters in your [gallery] short-code.

If you want to display links in the fancybox add the class "fancyframe" to them! ;)

Btw: Fancy Gallery is available as [Premium Plugin](http://dennishoppe.de/en/wordpress-plugins/fancy-gallery) too.
